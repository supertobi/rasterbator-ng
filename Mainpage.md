## Rasterbator-NG ##

### What is better in Rasterbator-NG then in the "original"Rasterbator? ###

  * Removed platform specific code (Rasterbator-NG works with Windows, MacOS X and Linux)
  * Automatic selection of the language
  * Creation of smaller PDF files
  * A little bit faster

### TODO ###

  * Update to latest itextsharp.dll
  * Update to latest ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
  * Create a new UI because the .resx file is missing, there is only the .resources
  * Clean up the project file
